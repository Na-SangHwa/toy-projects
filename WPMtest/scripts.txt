A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
A penny for your thoughts.
Actions speak louder than words.
All good things must come to an end.
All is fair in love and war.
An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
As you sow, so shall you reap.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Better late than never.
Better safe than sorry.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Don't cry over spilled milk.
Don't judge a book by its cover.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Every dog has its day.
Every man has his price.
Fortune favors the bold.
Haste makes waste.
Home is where the heart is.
If the shoe fits, wear it.
If you can't beat them, join them.
If you want something done right, do it yourself.
It takes two to tango.
Kill two birds with one stone.
Let the cat out of the bag.
Like father, like son.
Make hay while the sun shines.
Necessity is the mother of invention.
No pain, no gain.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Out of sight, out of mind.
Practice makes perfect.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Slow and steady wins the race.
The early bird catches the worm.
The grass is always greener on the other side.
The pen is mightier than the sword.
There's no smoke without fire.
Time heals all wounds.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
You reap what you sow.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today.
Every rose has its thorn.
Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.
If the cap fits, wear it.
It's a piece of cake.
It's raining cats and dogs.
Look before you leap.
Misery loves company.
One man's trash is another man's treasure.
People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
The best things in life are free.
The early bird gets the worm.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
There's no time like the present.
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
A picture is worth a thousand words.
Don't cry over spilt milk.
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
If the shoe fits, wear it.
In for a penny, in for a pound.
Let sleeping dogs lie.
Money doesn't grow on trees.
Practice what you preach.
The early bird catches the worm.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
When the cat's away, the mice will play.
You can't judge a book by its cover.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
All that glitters is not gold.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
Don't count your chickens before they're hatched.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
Every dog has its day.
It's never too late to learn.
Make hay while the sun shines.
The early bird gets the worm.
There's no smoke without fire.
Two heads are better than one.
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
You reap what you sow.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.
